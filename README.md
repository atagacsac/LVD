## ðŸ§  LLM Vulnerability Database Schema

This project introduces a database for documenting vulnerabilities in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with a focus on their application in **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**. This database aims to address that gap by organizing and presenting known LLM vulnerabilities to support threat analysis and enhance security research in this emerging field.

### ðŸ§° Field Highlights

- **LLM Version** â€“ Indicates which large language model is being targeted, helping contextualize vulnerability across different architectures.
- **Vulnerability Category (OWASP 10)** â€“ Classifies each attack using the OWASP LLM Top 10, aiding in standard risk assessment.
- **Tactic & Technique (MITRE ATLAS)** â€“ Maps each attack to standardized framework, for threat modeling.
- **Agentic Framework** â€“ Flags whether the attack relies on agent-based or autonomous systems, a growing concern in LLM deployment.
- **Impact (CIA Triad)** â€“ Clarifies whatâ€™s at risk Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability.
- **Severity & ASR** â€“ Together, these fields offer a quick read on how damaging and successful an attack is.
