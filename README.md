## ðŸ§  LLM Vulnerability Database Schema

This project introduces a database for documenting vulnerabilities in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with a focus on their application in **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**. This database aims to address that gap by organizing and presenting known LLM vulnerabilities to support threat analysis and enhance security research in this emerging field.

| `Attack Success Rate (ASR)`         | The success rate of the attack as reported by the Source, if avilable.                                  | `~95%`                                                 |
